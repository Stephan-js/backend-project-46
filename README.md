## Usage

### Standard Format

To use the utility in standard format, you can run:

```bash
gendiff file0.json file1.json
```

### Plain Format

To use the utility in plain format, you can run:

```bash
gendiff --format plain file0.json file1.json
```

### JSON Format

To use the utility in JSON format, you can run:

```bash
gendiff --format json file0.json file1.json
```

## Example

### Requist

Suppose we have two files:

`file0.json`:
```json
{
  "host": "github.com",
  "timeout": 50,
  "proxy": "123.234.53.22",
  "follow": false
}
```

`file1.json`:
```json
{
  "timeout": 20,
  "verbose": true,
  "host": "github.com"
}
```

### Standard Format

Running the utility with these files:

```bash
gendiff file0.json file1.json
```

Would produce the following Standart output:

```
{
  - follow: false
    host: github.com
  - proxy: 123.234.53.22
  - timeout: 50
  + timeout: 20
  + verbose: true
}
```

### Plain Format

Running the utility with these files:

```bash
gendiff --format plain file0.json file1.json
```

Would produce the following Plain output:

```
Property 'follow' was removed
Property 'proxy' was removed
Property 'timeout' was updated. From '50' to '20'
Property 'verbose' was added with value: true
```

### JSON Format

Running the utility with these files:

```bash
gendiff --format json file0.json file1.json
```

Would produce the following JSON output:

```json
[{"name":"follow","value":false,"status":"deleted"},{"name":"host","value":"github.com","status":"same"},{"name":"proxy","value":"123.234.53.22","status":"deleted"},{"name":"timeout","value":50,"status":"deleted"},{"name":"timeout","value":20,"status":"add"},{"name":"verbose","value":true,"status":"add"}]
```
